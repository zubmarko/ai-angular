3. provide routes as in old angular.js app for new angular

4. provide structure based on old app for new app

11. please migrate login page to new angular from angular.jd
use material ui
and keep all functionality as it is now
return only code of login component

12. change
    <button mat-raised-button color="primary" type="submit" [disabled]="loginForm.invalid">
      Login
    </button>
to use square button

13. change
    <button mat-raised-button color="primary" type="submit" [disabled]="loginForm.invalid">

14. ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(_AppModule)[_AuthService -> _HttpClient -> _HttpClient]: 
  NullInjectorError: No provider for _HttpClient!

15. in old app
we have authService
export default function authService($q) {
    const STORAGE_KEY = 'isAuthenticated';
    let isAuthenticated = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY)) || false;
  
    return {
      login: function(username, password) {
        if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
          isAuthenticated = true;
          localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(isAuthenticated));
          return $q.resolve();
        } else {
          return $q.reject('Invalid credentials');
        }
      },
      logout: function() {
        isAuthenticated = false;
        localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEY);
      },
      isAuthenticated: function() {
        return isAuthenticated;
      }
    };

18. Can't bind to 'ngIf' since it isn't a known property of 'form

19. Can't bind to 'ngIf' since it isn't a known property of 'div' (used in the '_StatisticsComponent' component template).
If the 'ngIf' is an Angular control flow directive, please make sure that either the 'NgIf' directive or the 'CommonModule' is a part of an @NgModule where this component is declared.

20. analyze header component 
and migrate to material ui and latest angular

21. Can't bind to 'matMenuTriggerFor' since it isn't a known property of 'button
